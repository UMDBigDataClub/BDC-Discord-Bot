# BDC-Discord-Bot
A discord bot for the UMass Dartmouth Big Data Club! Note that if you wish to run the bot yourself, you will need to place a .env file in the same folder as main.py. This file contains the keys and tokens necessary for interfacing with Discord and AWS for accessing our scoreboard. Please message @salbalkus (Sal Balkus on Discord) for access to the .env file.

### Current commands ###

/scoreboard : View the current scoreboard for the club

/add [integer] [name] : adds a score of [integer] to the Discord user whose username is [name]
